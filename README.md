## 📂 Folder Content  
- Trained classification model code.  

---

## ✅ Work Completed  
Developed the classification model to categorize device-related risks into:  
- **Class 1**: Recall  
- **Class 2**: Field Safety Device  
- **Class 3**: Safety Alert  

Additional functionalities implemented:  
- **Date parsing** in datasets  
- **Risk percentage calculation**  
- **Alerts generation**  
- **Timeline for alert retention** (days to be kept in the system)
